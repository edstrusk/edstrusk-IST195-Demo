## Skillset


### Problem Solver
  Passionate for puzzles and solving all types of problems. Upon completing a degree in Mathematics as well as undertaking a management position, it was apparent my passion had evolved into a skillset

### Technology Geek
  Born and raised alongside the dot-com bubble, I was fascinated by this emerging technology before I could walk on my own two feet. With each year of schooling my devotion only grew, until I was a full-fledged tech nerd. From here I would spend my days surfing the web, playing video games, and ultimately researching what possibilities my future could and would hold in this booming industry.

### Charismatic Leader
  My passion as a leader and IT administrator includes overview of local businesses in an effort to minimize disorganization and maximize productivity. With a detail-oriented approach I am able to visualize solutions to apparent inefficiencies. After developing a solution, and with a professional, albeit charismatic manner, I convey the fix to whomever is in charge.
